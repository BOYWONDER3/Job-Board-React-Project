### I will tag this my CAPSTONE PROJECT, This a job board website, Overall this project is my Reactjs course final project which covers almost all the concepts in Reactjs, built using ReactJs, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS, also implemets stripe for making payment to onboard jobs. The frontend development task covers 5 major tasks and will be listed accordingly as i complete each task. This project also contains some backend codes, I'm not a backend developer(currently), as this was a group work and the backend Team did the job. To use the full feature of the backend APi server, download the api folder and run it on your command line and also run the stripe setup. 

### PS: I'm having issues running the build command for deployment of this app. once resolved, the live page will be posted here thanks.
